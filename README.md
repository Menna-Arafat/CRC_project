**Welcome!** 

**Description:**
This book presents a comprehensive, R-based pipeline for metabolomics data analysis, from data preprocessing and normalization to network construction, visualization, and functional enrichment analysis. By integrating state-of-the-art tools such as WGCNA and MetaboAnalyst, the workflow enables systematic exploration of metabolomics datasets to uncover biologically meaningful patterns.

The pipeline has been applied in our published study: Ramzy, A., Abdelmoneim, T.K., Arafat, M., et al. (2025). Metabolomic analysis reveals key changes in amino acid metabolism in colorectal cancer patients. Amino Acids, 57, 22. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-025-03448-3


Please note:
- The workflow is identical to that described in our published paper, with the exception of a minimal change in the normalization step.
- The workflow does not include the manual curation step, which involves comparing MS/MS experimental spectra against reference libraries (e.g., HMDB, METLIN, GNPS, MassBank).
- The dataset provided here is a shuffled version. The original data can only be obtained from the corresponding author.
