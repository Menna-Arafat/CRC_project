  This book presents an end-to-end pipeline for metabolomics analysis, including raw data preprocessing, downstream analysis, visualization, Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and MetaboAnalyst integration.
 The workflow does not include the manual curation step that is to compare MS/MS experimental spectra to reference libraries (e.g., HMDB, METLIN, GNPS, MassBank).
  The whole pipeline was applied in our published study: Ramzy, A., Abdelmoneim, T.K., Arafat, M. et al. (2025), "Metabolomic analysis reveals key changes in amino acid metabolism in colorectal cancer patients" (Amino Acids, 57:22). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-025-03448-3.

# About {-}

This book presents a comprehensive, R-based pipeline for metabolomics data analysis, from data preprocessing and normalization to network construction, visualization, and functional enrichment analysis. By integrating state-of-the-art tools such as WGCNA and MetaboAnalyst, the workflow enables systematic exploration of metabolomics datasets to uncover biologically meaningful patterns.

The pipeline has been applied in our published study: Ramzy, A., Abdelmoneim, T.K., Arafat, M., et al. (2025). Metabolomic analysis reveals key changes in amino acid metabolism in colorectal cancer patients. Amino Acids, 57, 22. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-025-03448-3
